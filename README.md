# Food Truck Project

## Description
This is an app to store and rate your favorite food trucks. You can name them! 
You can tell us what type of food they serve! You can even rate them! To use this
app you must simply run the program in Eclipse. The app will do the rest. Use your
keyboard to tell the program exactly what you want to do. Name a truck? You got it!
See the average rating of trucks? Our pleasure! You can even quit after you input
each truck or at any time at the main menu. The possibilities are far from endless,
but the fun definitely is!


## Lessons Learned
Where do I start? This project began as a giant mass of code. I was resigned to do everything
in the simplest way possible. This led to a huge amount of dry code. I would hard code where 
loops would have worked. I had inputs that looked like they were feeding information but,
in reality were doing nothing. But things started to click with some guidance. I had been
led to realize that i had done too much. But I had also created guidelines. Big parts
of code may not have worked, but i knew what i wanted it to do. In fact I knew what I wanted
all parts to do. Now I just had to make that into a reality. Big blocks of code became a variable
and one or two lines. Some parts became a single word in another line of code. I spent a lot of
time making big mistakes, and later on I spent no time at all on a part that had been pretty 
complicated before. My biggest takeaway is: if you know what your mistakes are and you know
what you want them to look like to no longer be mistakes, the middle area is where you learn.
